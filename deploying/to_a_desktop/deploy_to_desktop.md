Turbo supports deploying containers from the Turbo.net hub directly to a desktop using the **Sync Device** feature.

## To a Desktop

#### Sync Device

The **Sync Device** feature on the Turbo.net Hub provides the ability to deploy applications directly to your desktop from the Hub in two simple steps:

1.) Add the applications you want
2.) Sync to your device

It's possible to add the latest version of any application, which will automatically update the application on your device as a new version is released.

Deploying applications requires two simple steps. Add applications in the Turbo.net hub, when complete just click **Sync Device** on your user or organization homepage.

The **Sync Device** button will update to show the syncing has begun.

When complete a prompt appears to confirm **Applications synced to Device** with an instruction that shortcuts have also been created in the start menu.

On your machine you will notice that a scheduled task has been created. The scheduled task will perform the application updates. Modify the schedule to ensure the applications are only updated when you want them to. Optionally, **Run** the task to cache the applications. If you do not run the task, launching an application will present a buffer dialog on first launch.
