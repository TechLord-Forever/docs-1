## Shell Registration

Images can also be integrated with the Windows shell. The `register` command will create Start Menu shortcuts and file associations in the shell for the image so that it behaves similar to an installed application.

```
# Register 7-zip to the shell
> turbo register 7-zip/7-zip
```

Configuring shortcuts and file associations for an image is done in Turbo Studio. See the [reference](/docs/reference/turbo-studio) section for more details.
