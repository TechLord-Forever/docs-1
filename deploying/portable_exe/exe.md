## Portable EXE

A popular option for organizations that have an existing endpoint management solution like LANDesk Management Suite &reg;, Microsoft System Center, or Novell ZENworks is to deploy containerized applications as standalone executables. These executables are built on the SVM architecture and work just like a container. 

Deploying applications within containers is convenient for running different versions of applications like Internet Explorer 8 and 11 side-by-side on the same system. 

To produce an executable output, set the **Project Type** to **Application** in Turbo Studio.   Executables can be deployed directly to the users device or to a network share and do not have any dependency requirements.

An enterprise license for Turbo Studio is required to enable executable outputs. Contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@turbo.net) for more information.
