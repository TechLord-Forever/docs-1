Spoon Studio, allows developers and systems administrators to build Turbo images through a friendly graphical user interface. Spoon Studio is most commonly used for it's "snapshot" method of containerization. Read more about Spoon Studio [here](/docs/reference#ide).

The command-line interface is a command line tool for creating containers and building images in real-time. The command-line interface also provides a suite of tools for managing containers and images.

**Developers** can use the command-line interface to containerize their entire developer stack into their application -- ensuring that the same product a developer sees is the one encountered by end-users.

**System administrators** can use the command-line interface to more effectively manage their infrastructure.
