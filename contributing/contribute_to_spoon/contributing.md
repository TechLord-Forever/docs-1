## Contribute to Turbo

Welcome to the Turbo community!

All build scripts for Turbo images are open sourced, so please contribute! You're also welcome to edit our Docs if you would like to add or change anything.

During our beta period, users who submit pull requests will be sent a Turbo swag kit filled with shirts, caps, hoodies, and other Turbo gear.

You can contribute **image build scripts** [**here**](https://github.com/turboapps/spoonme).

You can add and edit **turbo.net/docs** [**here**](https://github.com/turboapps/docs).

Things we love to see:

- Additions, fixes, or improvements to our tutorials and documentation.
- Build scripts, recipes, and walkthroughs for new images and containers.
- New projects built with Turbo's Windows containers in mind. Like [PowerSpoon](https://github.com/turboapps/powerspoon), a community-made PowerShell module for our CLI!

If you have an idea for an improvement but lack the time to make a pull request, ping us on our [user group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/turbo-users), tweet [@turboapps](http://twitter.com/turboapps), or email us at [support@turbo.net](mailto:support@turbo.net).
